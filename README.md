## Introduction
  - In this project our team was able to achieve writing clean HTML and CSS to match the provided Comp. We worked to implement separate data and DOM models. We also incorporated and iterated over arrays to filter what was being displayed in the DOM. Finally, we focused on creating clean, DRY JavaScript.
## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
## Illustrations

## Features
   Users are able to input title and body content, and save to view in an idea-card. They are also able to favorite the idea "on click", and update the "star" icon. Additionally, they are able to remove the user-created idea-cards.  
## Deployed Page
Visit our published Ideabox application! [here](https://mr-daniels-2025.github.io/Ideabox/)
## Possible Future Extensions
    Future extensions would allow the user to save and view favorited cards on a separate page; and remove favorited cards from the save-page.  In addition, users would be able to search for a specific, favorited card.
